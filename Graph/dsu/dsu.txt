If we have 4 node say , 1,2,3,4 which each belong to their own set

If we make a array parent with size 4 and initialzed to -1 
then it shows that it is the parent of its own
that node itself is the set

Union(1,2) => 2 is made the parent of 1
Arr : -1 ,"1", -1 , -1
Nums:  1 , 2 ,  3 , 4

Union (3,4) => 3 is made parent of 4
Arr : -1 , 1 , -1 , "3"
Nums:  1 , 2 ,  3 , 4


From the current Arr we can say that we have two sets as their are two places where
we have -1 in the Arr.

Leader / Parent of the Set :> Root of the set which is represted by -1 , we have two leaders : 1 , 3

> Union(1,4)
Find out the set where ele 1 belongs : s1 ( 1 , 2 ) = set given by Find(1)
Find out the set where ele 3 belongs : s2 ( 3 , 4 ) = given by Find(3)

if(s1 != s3 ) we can merge them :=> parent of s2 = s3 
parent[s2] = s1;

Arr : -1 , 1 ,"1", 3
Nums:  1 , 2 , 3 , 4
 
We would visualze the union/find by a tree , but implement it using the array.
The array will store the parent of that particualr elem.

Union(2,3) => Makes the graph a cycle
s1 = find(2) = 1
s2 = find(3) = 1 
if both the eme belong to the same set then cycle would be created/present.

Pseudo Code / Time Complexity Analysis :

Union (1,2)
Union (3,4)
Union (1,4)
Union (2,3)

// Return the Parent of the set
int find (int  i){
    id(parent[i] == -1)
        return i;
    return find(parent[i]);
}
Worst Case : O(n) Time , it can be optimized 

void Union( a , b){
    s1 = find(a); 
    s2 = find(b);

    if(s1 != s2)
    parent[s2] = s1;
}
Worst Case : O(n) Time , it can also be optimized


Optimizations
-------------

1. Path Compression (Find fn)
2. Union by Rank (Union Fn)

// 1. Path Compression
We make the direct parents to the childrens
int find (int  i){
    id(parent[i] == -1)
        return i;
    return parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
}

// 2. Union by Rank
Rank : is the number of child nodes which a node have
Union by rank : attach the smaller tree with the bigger tree
i.e. smaller rank tree will be attached to the higher rank parent

By doing both the Optimizations the Time Complexity is almost O(1) (approx.)
If we only do the path Compression then the Optimization of DSU is O(Log(N)) on average
